This document outlines and describes the design, implementation and testing of a fitness tracking application `GoAber'. GoAber is a dual language (JavaEE and .NET) web application to allow educational institutions to interact and challenge each other. Students and staff are able to sign up, join groups such as courses or departments, and join challeneges from inter-university groups, or groups in other universities. Communication between users will be sent via the web, and data will be stored within a single database at each institution. \par
This project follows an agile approach to development, and puts to the test a number of agile practises, and wide variety of technologies. This project has been performed in a similar style to a professional real-world project.
