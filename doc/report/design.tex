\chapter{Design}

This section outlines the initial designs for the system to be produced. As this project is being developed using a Scrum based development methodology, there is no concrete up front design for the system. Much of the design presented here was created during the initial stages of the project and therefore has been subject to change throughout the implementation stages of the project. However, we were not going to start development on the project without any design whatsoever. Especially since nearly all team members were unfamiliar the technologies we were going to be working with.
