Installation Instructions - GF Domain File
------------------------------------------

1) Find the domains folder for your Glassfish instance.
 - In Netbeans:
	- Goto: ‘Services’ tab -> Servers -> Glassfish (Right-click)
	- Click ‘Properties’
	- Observe ‘Domains Folder’ file path location

2) Go to this folder on Mac or Windows.

3) Open the domain instance folder (in most cases, this will be called ‘domain1’)

4) Backup the existing ‘domain.xml’ file (rename to ‘domain-old.xml’)

5) Go to GoAber Repo/conf/glassfish and copy the ‘domain.xml’ file into the GF domain folder currently open.

6) Make sure to STOP and RESTART the Glassfish Server via Netbeans.

TO TEST:

1) Open up the GF admin console (via Netbeans)

2) Navigate to: ‘server-config’ -> ‘Security’ -> ‘Realms’

3) In the list of realms, there should now be a realm called ‘GoAberRealm’. If this realm is not in the list, the configuration file has not been updated correctly.
